# RedWine-Alcohol-Lvl-Prediction-Using-RegressionModels

This project explores regression techniques training models to  predict alcohol percentage of red wines based on their chemical properties using the Wine Quality (Red) dataset. After exploratory data analysis and baseline modeling, several regression algorithms were trained and evaluated, mainly Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest. Among all models, the Random Forest model achieved the best performance, with R^2 ~ 0.78 and an RMSE ~ 0.51, significantly outperforming both the baseline and linear models.
